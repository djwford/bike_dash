      Notes:
        ☐ start the server:
            rails s Puma
        ☐ because we changed eager_load and cache_classes to :true in development.rb, you'll have to restart the server every time you change your code
          ☐ you may want to change these back when you're not specifically editing code having to do with SSEs
